# Python's primitive types are: integer, float, boolean and string.
# Let's create variables to store some values:
number_int = 5
number_float = 5.5
string = 'Hello world!'
boolean = True

# Use triple quotes for 'long strings' (formatted)
long_string = """Hi John,
How are you doing?"""

# Use the 'print' function to display values on the terminal.
print('\nPrinting a number' + number_int)

# Escape characters:
# An escape character is a backslash (\) followed by the character you want to insert.
# Escape sequences examples: \', \", \n
# print('\') --> Error. '\' is a special character. Fix this using a escape sequence:
print('\nEscape characters: \\, \', \"')
